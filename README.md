# Course Work
A complete up-to-date repository of my coursework.

## Courses
* [SSW 215 Individual Software Engineering]()
* [SSW 315 Object-Oriented Software Development]()
* [CS 115 Intro to Computer Science]()
* [CS 135 Discrete Structures](https://github.com/robertschaedler3/CS-135)

   The aim of this course is to integrate knowledge of basic mathematics with the problems involving specification, design, and computation. By the end of the course, the student should be able to: use sets, functions, lists, and relations in the specification and design of problems; use properties of arithmetic, modular arithmetic (sum, product, exponentiation), prime numbers, greatest common divisor, factoring, Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem; use binary, decimal, and base-b notation systems and translation methods; use induction to design and verify recursive programs; and implement in Scheme all algorithms considered during the course.
   
* [CS 284 Data Structures](https://github.com/robertschaedler3/CS-284)

   This is a course on standard data structures, including sorting and searching and using the Java language. The topics include: stages of software development; testing; UML diagrams; elementary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, and maps); use of elementary data structures in application frameworks; searching; sorting; and introduction to asymptotic complexity analysis.

* [CS 385 Algorithms]()
* [CS 392 Systems Programming]()
